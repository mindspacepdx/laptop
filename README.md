Laptop
======

Laptop is a script to set up an OS X laptop for development.

Requirements
------------

We support:

* [OS X Mavericks (10.9)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-mavericks/id675248567)
* [OS X Yosemite (10.10)](https://www.apple.com/osx/)

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested. Bug reports for older
versions are welcome.

Install
-------

Read, then run the script:

    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mindspacepdx/laptop/master/mac) 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log

Debugging
---------

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`. Read through it to see if
you can debug the issue yourself. If not, copy the lines where the script
failed into a new issue. 

What it sets up
---------------

* [Bundler] for managing Ruby libraries
* [Exuberant Ctags] for indexing files for vim tab completion
* [Foreman] for serving Rails apps locally
* [Git] for version control
* [gh] for interacting with the GitHub API
* [Homebrew] for managing operating system libraries
* [ImageMagick] for cropping and resizing images
* [Node.js] and [NPM], for running apps and installing JavaScript packages
* [NVM] for managing versions of Node.js
* [Qt] for headless JavaScript testing via Capybara Webkit
* [Rails] gem for writing web applications
* [Rbenv] for managing versions of Ruby
* [Redis] for storing key-value data
* [Ruby Build] for installing Rubies
* [Ruby] stable for writing general-purpose code
* [SASS] CSS compiler
* [The Silver Searcher] for finding things in files
* [Watch] for periodically executing a program and displaying the output
* [Zsh] as your shell

It should take less than 15 minutes to install (depends on your machine).

Laptop can be run multiple times on the same machine safely. It will upgrade
already installed packages and install and activate a new version of ruby (if
one is available).

Make your own customizations
----------------------------

Put your customizations in `~/.laptop.local`. For example, your
`~/.laptop.local` might look like this:

    #!/bin/sh

    brew tap caskroom/cask
    brew install brew-cask

    brew cask install dropbox
    brew cask install google-chrome
    brew cask install rdio

You should write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than
once. See the `mac` script for examples.
